# Advanced-GIS-System
This is a slight improvement from my simple earthquake repository, which was originally inspired by the coding train coding challenge #57.

Just run GisMain.py in the modules folder. Also, its my first time really thinking hard and having to create tests for my code, so I have noticed that it might be redundant or perhaps meaningless in some parts of it.
